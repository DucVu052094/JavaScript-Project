# JavaScript-Project
These are small projects that I created to learn how to use javaScript

Pizza Menu:

This project is a menu website that let the user choose various sizes, toppings and vegetables for their pizza. It uses javascript to calculate the price based on user's selection.

Tic-Tac-Toe Game:

This project ultilizes javascript to make the AI randomly choose a number which then select a square in a 3x3 table to play tic-tac-toe with the user.

Calculator:

A basic 4 function calculator that can add, subtract, multiply and divide numbers on a website.
